# BitByBit

In this app, you chat anonymously. The reason I chose anonymously was that thinking about the other person only through conversation, without any prejudice or perception, would help make friends. And after the chat is over, the person will take a quiz about the other person, which the other person had made in advance. There is a score system in the app, and scores are given by calculating the number of words and chat time used while chatting. In addition, the number of problems corrected in the quiz of 3 questions is calculated and points are given. The scores given in this way can be checked on My Page, and the ranking system can be used to check your ranking in total. You can also divide your tier according to your score to see your current tier. You can check from the ranking if you are between 1st and 5th place.

## Motivation

The outbreak of corona virus changed our society in many ways. The biggest change is that people communicate primarily through online medium. It is impossible, at the moment, to physically meet up with friends and even, make new friends. In order to aid these difficulties and cure boredom, we created and app that enables chatting and solving quizzes with friends.
